## Activities

I was sick the latter half of the week, and had barely any energy and time for the project.
I had a meeting on thursday to discuss project specs with course director. Received helpful advice, based on which I will focus the project first on purely one faceted sequential note generation with Markov chain and work on the other aspects of my idea if it is then satisfactory how the Markov chain implementation works. (have not updated project spec doc on this yet)

After the meeting my health status got worse and I could not work until sunday, when I got some work done on this while also catching up on other things that were starting to be late.

What did I get done? Some initial coding, forming of trie tree and some thinking on how best to make the Markov chain work on that.

After working hard on monday night and deciding to not risk my health to do more - I decided that even though I should be finishing the already passed deadline stuff right now, it doesn't become more important than my health.

I'm finishing last weeks    

## Project Progression

- Basic idea formation, requirement specification, general preparations done.

## Notes on Learning

I learned about the basic concept of Markov chains and what projects have been done with them in regards to music. No idea about the technical details yet, which shall be the next step.
Not much learning in repo setup and such first week activities - since getting to know those kinds of things in previous courses. But repetition is good for memory.

## Challenges / Issues

Lack of knowledge on the fuctionality of Markov chains leading to a difficulty in estimating the project in terms of time, difficulty and possible results

## What next

- Research on Markov chains and possibly some rudimentary tests on how it works
- Forming project structure, some basic classes etc.
- Setting up testing, pylint, poetry and such
