## Activities

Added auxiliary rules, refactored and documented.
Demonstrated the applications functionality and the fundamental concepts of trie -tree structures and Markov chains in a demo session.

## Project Progression

Added auxiliary rules to add restrictions to the generated notes in such a way that some of the shortcomings that Markov chains are susceptible to can be avoided and tha the produced musical notes would follow some basic harmonic rules in context with a pre-existing simultaneuous line of music.

## Notes on Learning

Not much in terms of learning this time because the last sessions on the projects were spent mostly with cleanup and documentation efforts, and adding some code that was quite easy. Sure even routine things like that do involve learning in some ways by 

## Challenges / Issues

None, except for lack of time as always.

## What next

Project is finished in terms of the course - but continuing to tweak its functionality to use it as a plugin in a sheet music generation application.
