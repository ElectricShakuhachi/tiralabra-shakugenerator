## Activities

I had barely any time for the project this week due to other engagements and situation with
my children being sick again, so I've barely progressed. Last weeks changes were a bit radical and fast so most of this weeks activities have been debugging.


## Project Progression

Most problems introduced by last weeks updates have been solved, some in the middle of being solved but the root causes are visible. The project should take another step forward in the coming week.
