## Activities

I started the project on Friday evening, so I was a bit pressed on time to come up with a topic. Most of the time this week was spent thinking about it while writing
the specification document. Besides that I familiarized with the course documentation, set up the project in Github etc. necessary preparation. I did not have much time to
start research on the actual topic - beyond a superficial look into Markov chains to understand what could actually be done with them.

## Project Progression

- Basic idea formation, requirement specification, general preparations done.

## Notes on Learning

I learned about the basic concept of Markov chains and what projects have been done with them in regards to music. No idea about the technical details yet, which shall be the next step.
Not much learning in repo setup and such first week activities - since getting to know those kinds of things in previous courses. But repetition is good for memory.

## Challenges / Issues

Lack of knowledge on the fuctionality of Markov chains leading to a difficulty in estimating the project in terms of time, difficulty and possible results

## What next

- Research on Markov chains and possibly some rudimentary tests on how it works
- Forming project structure, some basic classes etc.
- Setting up testing, pylint, poetry and such
